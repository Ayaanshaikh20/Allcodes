//Object oriented programming

//Constrctor function and the "new" operator

//We can not use arrow function as constructor

//Call "constructor" function using "new" keyword

//1 new {object} created empty initially
//2 "this" = {object}
//3 object linked to prototype
//4 functional automatically return {object}
